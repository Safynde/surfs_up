# Investing in Surf and Ice cream
# Project Overview
     W. Avy wants to invest in a surf and shake shop, specializing in selling surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists. W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
# Results
•	Based on the analysis of the data, in June the mean temperature is 74.94 degrees which is a perfect temperature for both surfing and ice cream. In June, the minimum temperature is 64, and the standard deviation of temperatures is 3.26. Overall, the temperature is most likely to be around the mid to high 70s.

•	December is slightly colder than June, the mean temperature is 71.04 degrees.  Between June and December, there is a drop of 3.9 degrees which is a 5.34% drop. The minimum temperature is 56 degrees the standard deviation is low for December at 3.75. This indicates the chance of temperatures dropping down to temperatures in the 50s is unlikely.

•	The standard deviation for both June and December is around 3 degrees, this suggests that the fluctuation in weather is minimal. Within 2 standard deviations, the temperature continues to remain in the 70-degree weather. This weather is ideal for opening a surf and shake shop in Hawaii.
# Summary 
W. Avy wanted more information about the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Based on June and December data analysis, most of the days have a comfortable temperature throughout the year. The weather is favorable to open this type of business. The temperature cannot be opened based on the temperature alone. There is a need to take into consideration additional for example the amount of rainfall in June and December. Based on the analysis the precipitation in June and December is low, therefore the rainfall will not have an impact on the business in June and December.
